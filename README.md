## üõ† Installation
- `pyenv` from [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- `poetry`: ```pip install poetry```
- all the needed packages from `pyproject.toml` and your own `venv`:
	- ```pyenv install 3.9.6 && pyenv local 3.9.6```
	- `poetry` instruction can be found [here](https://blog.jayway.com/2019/12/28/pyenv-poetry-saviours-in-the-python-chaos/)
	- ```poetry update```
- you can find the `get_data.sh` script in the `data/` folder: ```cd data/ && /bin/bash get_data.sh```


## üèó Structure
- `ad-hoc`: a directory for notebooks and ad-hoc scripts.
	- Contains everybody's sandboxes.
- `scripts`: a directory for models and training scripts.
	- Please create separate branches for any hypothesis you have.

## üóí Notes
I added [wemake-python-styleguide](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/) flake8 plugin and some autoreformatters to dev dependencies. Please use `black` at least.
